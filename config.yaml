      Alertmanager configuration file (yaml), with the exclusion of the templates section.

  templates_file:
    type: string
    description: >
      Alertmanager templates definition file. This is a slight deviation from the official
      alertmanager config spec. All templates need to go into this single config option, instead of
      the 'templates' section of the main configuration file. The templates will be pushed to the
      workload container, and the configuration file will be updated accordingly.
      Refer to https://prometheus.io/docs/alerting/latest/notification_examples/ for more details
      on templates.
    default: ""
  web_external_url:
    description: |
      The URL under which Alertmanager is externally reachable (for example,
      if Alertmanager is served via a reverse proxy).
      Must include the scheme (http or https).
      Used for generating relative and absolute links back to
      Alertmanager itself. If the URL has a path portion, it will be used to
      prefix all HTTP endpoints served by Alertmanager.
      If omitted, relevant URL components will be derived automatically.
      If provided, this should be a complete URI, including scheme, or a
      fully qualified subpath starting with `/`.
      If Alertmanager is being served directly from the root of a fully-qualified
      host or a bare A record, this may be omitted.
      This configuration option takes precedence over the URL provided over
      the "ingress" relation.
