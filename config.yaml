    description: >
      Alertmanager templates definition file. This is a slight deviation from the official
      alertmanager config spec. All templates need to go into this single config option, instead of
      the 'templates' section of the main configuration file. The templates will be pushed to the
      workload container, and the configuration file will be updated accordingly.
      Refer to https://prometheus.io/docs/alerting/latest/notification_examples/ for more details
      on templates.
