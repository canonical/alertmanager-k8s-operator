"""Feature: The workload's scheme is reflected in the pebble command and in relation data.

This feature spans:
- manifest generation (pebble layer)
- schema generation (alertmanager_dispatch provider)

The alertmanager server can serve over HTTP or HTTPS. The requirer side of the relation may be
design to take URL parts rather than a full URL. Prometheus takes URL parts and would need to
generate its "alertmanagers" config section differently depending on the scheme.
